# Introduction

Dr. Olga, a professor at CSU Long Beach will give a talk and advanced regression models. It is based on her recently released book "Advanced Regression Models with SAS and R." This will also be a great introduction to the short course that we are planning for September. Check out the book at https://www.amazon.com/dp/1138049018/

George G Vega Yon will be talking about doing high-performance computing in R. He will discuss the 'parallel' package for parallel computing, Rcpp integrating C++ R, RcppArmadillo which is a linear algebra library and OpenMP which is an API for multiprocessing applications.

Come early, network, enjoy the food and talks. Do not forget to purchase a raffle ticket or two. It helps support the meet-up and we have a great prize.

# Talk 1

## Title: Regression Models for Count Data
## Speaker: Olga Korosteleva
## Abstract
In my presentation, I plan to give a brief overview of various regression models: their settings, mathematical expressions, and implementation to datasets with complete R codes. The following models will be considered: linear (normal response), gamma (right-skewed response), logistic (binary response), Poisson, zero-truncated Poisson, zero-inflated Poisson, longitudinal model, and hierarchical model.

# Talk 2

## Title: A Brief Introduction to Using R for High-Performance Computing
## Speaker: George G Vega Yon
## Abstract
While the R programming language was not developed for High-Performance Computing (think about the ‘for’ loops!), thanks to its always thriving community of users, there are several ways in which R can be used to perform HPC. In this presentation, I will give you a general overview of HPC in R with a particular focus on multi-core processing (i.e. no big data for now), and introduce some of the available tools for enhancing your R code. The presentation will include some examples using the 'parallel' package, Rcpp, and Rcpp(Armadillo) + OpenMP.
