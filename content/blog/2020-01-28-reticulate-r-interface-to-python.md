# Introduction

This month this we are going to try something new and break from our traditional two talks. Michael Espero is going to introduce the 'reticulate' package. Reticulate provides a comprehensive set of tools for interoperability between Python and R. The package includes facilities for:

* Calling Python from R in a variety of ways including R Markdown, sourcing Python scripts, importing Python modules, and using Python interactively within an R session.

* Translation between R and Python objects (for example, between R and Pandas data frames, or between R matrices and NumPy arrays).

* Flexible binding to different versions of Python including virtual environments and Conda environments.

Reticulate embeds a Python session within your R session, enabling seamless, high-performance interoperability. If you are an R developer that uses Python for some of your work or a member of data science team that uses both languages, reticulate can dramatically streamline your workflow!

Come early, network and enjoy the food. Do not forget your laptop with R and Python installed.
