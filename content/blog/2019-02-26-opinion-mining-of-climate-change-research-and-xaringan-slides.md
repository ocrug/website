<strong>Title: Opinion Mining of Climate Change Research</strong>

Climate is defined as the long-term impact of weather on a specific locality. Statistically, climate is defined as the average weather for a specific area over a defined period, usually over three to four decades. Over the years we have seen the socioeconomic impacts of climate change on public health, agriculture/nutrition, nutrient cycle, migration, local economy. In recent times, there has been a huge debate on the polarity of climate change impact, with energy companies arguing against the impact of climate change while the government regulators arguing for. In this study we assessed the sentiments/opinions of general discourse of NSF funded climate change research to ascertain if funding source influences the outcome of the research.
