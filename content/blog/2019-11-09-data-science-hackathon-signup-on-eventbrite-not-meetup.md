**********************

This is the first Orange Country R Users Group (OCRUG) data science hackathon. During this event, we will be exploring an interesting data set, starting from the raw data all the way through to a final "end product" (e.g. a data visualization, an interesting data insight, a predictive model, etc.).

This event is open to all experience levels, from the complete beginner to the highly experienced. Participants will work in teams to "hack" through the data and will present their work at the end of the event for prizes. You are free to create your own team, or we will assist in team creation if you do not have one. This is a great way to network, share, and learn from others.

The main goal of the hackathon is to promote team work and foster education and learning in a welcoming environment. Though teams will competing to present their best work at the end of the event for prizes, communication and providing assistance across teams is highly encouraged. We will provide in-person training during the hackathon and online training prior to the event.

Participants will need to bring their own computers during the event.

We have set up a GitHub repository that has more information about the hackathon. Such as the schedule; setting up slack and much more. Further information will be provided prior to the event.

Your ticket includes meals, snacks and drinks during the event. Optionally, parking at UCI is $10 per day.

All participants must abide by the OCRUG Code of Conduct and R Consortium Code of Conduct.
