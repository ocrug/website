March Madness, the NCAA basketball tournament that takes us by storm every March is right around the corner. ncaahoopR is an R package for working with NCAA Basketball Play-by-Play Data. It scrapes play-by-play data and returns it to the user in a tidy format and allows the user to explore the data with assist networks and in-game win-probability charts.
