Telling Meaningful Stories with Data (Alyssa C.)

According to Edward Tufte, an excellent data visualization expresses â€š complex ideas communicated with clarity, precision and efficiency. Visualization is a dynamic form of persuasion, telling a story through the graphical depiction of statistical information. Few forms of communication are as persuasive as a compelling narrative. So how does a data scientist tell a meaningful story with a visualization? The analysis has to find the story that the data supports, and journalists have become very good at storytelling with visualization via infographics. In that vein, this presentation will share how some journalistic strategies on telling a good story can be applied to data visualization.

Custom htmlwidgets: connecting Javascript to Shiny (Alan D.)

The parts of Shiny that run in the browser are implemented in Javascript, and Shiny can be extended and enhanced in interesting ways by connecting Shiny to custom Javascript or Javascript libraries. Shiny supports 3 means of Javascript integration: custom inputs, custom outputs, and htmlwidgets. Of these, htmlwidgets are the most general and powerful, as they can work offline and embedded in RMarkdown. In this talk I'll give an overview of Shiny's relationship to Javascript, show how new htmlwidgets can be built using the React.js framework and integrated with Shiny, and share resources for doing front-end web development in a Shiny context.
