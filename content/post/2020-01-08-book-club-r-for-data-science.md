Details
We are looking to start a book club to improve our R skills. It will be headed up by Xi Chen. The idea is to motivate us to read books and discussing them together. This will help all of us to develop our skills.

The format will be that the leader will prepare a short summary of the material and present it to the group. We will then discuss the material and do some exercises.

The expectations are that you will attend regularly once you sign up for a book. If you cannot, please wait until the next round starts with a new book. It is also expected that participants will take turns being the leader.

We will meet each week, Wednesday evening between 7:00 and 8:30 PM. The location is TBD but it will most likely be in a coffee shop in Irvine.
