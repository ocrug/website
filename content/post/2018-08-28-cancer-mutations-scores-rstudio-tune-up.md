Talk 1: Classification and Statistical Analysis of Cancer Mutations Scores
By: Yemi Odeyemi (Ph.D. Candidate in Data Science at Chapman University)

The talk will describe part of Yemi's doctoral work on building a statistical and predictive model to classify driver-passenger mutations. A Logit model is used with 10-fold cross-validation. The data was preprocessed to impute missing values using the rule-of-thumb approach, removal of redundant features and feature scaling. Feature selection was determined using a stepwise approach based on AIC. The objective was to determine the optimal class boundary for the probability for discretization. The models were evaluated with Receiver Operator Characteristics - Area under the curve (ROC-AUC) which is based on sensitivity and specificity.

Talk 2: Tune up your RStudio Experience
By: Ryan Benz (SoCal Bioinformatics, Inc.)

In this talk, Ryan will discuss some of the ways you can tune-up your RStudio experience to make it easier to work with and to stream line commonly performed tasks to support your coding and analysis work.
